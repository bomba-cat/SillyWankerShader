Silly Wanker Shader is a minecraft shader which aims to bring the vanilla look of minecraft while still having "shader" features any other shaders have. We also have a big heart for having as much features as possible. If you liked the shader you should also check out [Escheridia](https://modrinth.com/shader/escheridia)
